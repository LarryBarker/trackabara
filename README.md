## About Trackabara

Trackabara is a RESTful API for helping track pesty capybaras. The API provides endpoints for adding new capybaras, including their name, color, and size, as well as an observations endpoint to track capybara movements between major cities like Chicago, Atlanta, New York, Houston, and San Francisco.

We are currently tracking 3 particularly pesky capybaras named Colossus, Steven, and Capybaby. Feel free to help us track these rodents with new observations, or let us know about other capybaras you have observed as well!

## Installation

1. Clone this repo to your machine `git clone git@github.com:larrybarker/trackabara.git`
2. Install composer dependencies `composer install`
3. Copy the env example to your project root `cp .env.example .env`
4. Generate a new application key `php artisan key:generate`
5. Create a new database named `trackabara`
6. Run database migrations `php artisan migrate`
7. Optionally seed data to get started `php artisan db:seed`

### Testing

A basic test suite is including to ensure capybaras can be added to the datbase and that observations are unique to a specific capybara, city, and date combination.

You can run the test suite with PHPUnit by running the following command from your project root:

`vendor/bin/phpunit`
